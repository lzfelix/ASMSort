# ASMSort

This is an Assambly 8086 inline implementation of Bubble Sort on C. I wrote this code just for fun (and because I really like asm coding sometimes), while I was taking Assambly Language course at university. I am posting it here to not lose it again =(

# Instructions

To compile this rare piece of work you will need:
 * __DOSBox__: different versions for a plenty of OSs can be obtained at http://www.dosbox.com/
 * __Turbo C++ 3.0__: can be free downloaded at http://borlandc.org/download-turbo-c-3-0-for-windows-7-windows-8-and-windows-xp/

 Then you just need to install DOSBox and the C++ environment on DOSBox, compile the code and run.
 (I did not tested compilling the code directly on Windows using this compiller. If it works, please, let me know!)
 
# Further comments

You can freely change the size of the vector and also use negative numbers. Everything will work just fine.
